# Ruby War

## ♠ ♥ ♣ ♦

### usage 
```
irb
load('war.rb')



# play a single game
play_game(false)


# simulate a number of games
simulate(game_count)


uncomment puts statements to see the outcomes of a game in realtime (+various debugging statements that have been left in)
this gets ugly very fast when simulating > ~100 games, and fills the terminal taking forever to print, so I commented them.

TODO: add flag for printing out hands during each round.
